This is a simple 2D platformer game developed as a project for my Game Programming course.
The game includes basic platformer mechanics such as player movement, jumping, rolling, ledge grabbing, attacking, dropping down through specific platforms, enemies, a boss and level progression.
Developed using Unity.

Feel free to explore, play, or improve it!
